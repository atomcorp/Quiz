QUIZ

Abstract :

 ☐ Quiz is an easy way to link together simple quizzes
 ☐ A question, and then (2-4?) answers can be uploaded per question
 ☐ Uploaded has to mark which answer is correct
 ☐ System will randomise question order, and answer order
 ☐ Any number of questions can be stringed together to create a quiz
 ☐ Each quiz can also have an image uploaded, and a title and descripton
 ☐ The layout will be standardised, ala Facebook
 ☐ The site will use a database such as Firebase to store questions
 ☐ The site may record right/wrong answers, and total scores from players
 ☐ Each quiz will have it's own url eg quiz.com/kanye, quiz.com/arsenal
 ☐ Show results at end of quiz, users score (piechart), compare with previous user's answers (eg 80% got Q5 correct)


Ideas :
  ☐ questions can have optional time-limits imposed (30s - 1 min)
  ☐ upload images as answers
  ☐ upload text or numbers as answers, eg q: Where is Henry from? User taking quiz writes 'France'
  ☐ 2 - 4 answers can be added
  ☐ quiz setter can choose scoring system
  ☐ Show quiz progress - such as 4/10
  ☐ restart button for debugging
  ☐ transition between questions - swipe or transition animation to show something happened, then q&a have changed

Pages :
  ☐ Add a Quiz (on front page?)
    ☐ Will be able to upload each question on one page
    ☐ Already add Qs will be visable 
  ☐ Take Quiz
